<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;"><strong style="font-size:50px;">Looking to Drop a Few Pounds?</strong><br><br>Whether your looking to kickstart your 
new fitness goals or just shed a few pounds to look your best at the beach, there are a few simple things you can do to lose some extra weight 
with very little effort!

<p style="color:lightgrey; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><strong style="color: white; font-size: 50px;">Eat Smaller Meals More Frequently</strong><br><br>
This works because when you eat more frequently it revs up your metabolism. On top of that eating more frequently results in you becoming hungry less often throughout the day 
decreasing the chance of you overeating when you do sit down for a meal. Another advantage this provides is it keeps your blood sugar steady. 
3-5 hours after a meal your body starts to run out of nutrients from your last meal and your blood sugar begins to plummit. The result is you becomae lathargic
and reach for anything you can to refuel.

<div id="aboutbody" style="background-color: white; border:0;">
<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;"><strong style="font-size:50px;">Drink Water</strong><br><br>This should be a given. Your body needs water and while 
other beverages throughout the day are fine in moderation, water should be your main source of hydration. Drinking enough water daily will actaully
help you drop some of the water your body was retaining as well as increasing your metabolism. If desired drinking water before meals works as an apetite suppressant
resulting in you eating less and lsoing more weight.

<div id="aboutbody" style="background: none;">
<p style="color:lightgrey; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><strong style="color: white; font-size: 50px;">Avoid Refined Carbohydrates</strong><br><br>
Refined Carbs refer to  sugar and grains that have been rid of their nutritious and fibrous value. This includes white breads and pasta. This spikes your blood sugar and cause it to crash
which in turn cause hunger and cravings that make you eat more. Stick to complex carbs that provide a steadier blood sugar increase. Examples include brown rice, and whole grain foods.
