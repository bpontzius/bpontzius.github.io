<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;"><strong style="font-size:50px;">Hit A Plateue?</strong><br><br>One of the main problems people hit when trying to get lean
is hitting a plateue, a point in your program where progress slows down drastically or halts altogether.When striving for single digit body fat
this happens often. Your body will fight back trying to hold on to fat, this is a survival instinct. So what are you to do when this happens?
Below you will find a few tips to break through this barrier and look better than you have ever looked before!

<div id="aboutbody" style="background: none;">
<p style="color:lightgrey; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><strong style="color: white; font-size: 50px;">Change Your Diet</strong><br><br>While your current diet may have worked on your journey so far, you may have to change it
to get your desired results. As you lose weight or gain weight your required caloric intake and macronutrients change as well. While eating 
2000 calories made you lose weight before you may now need to drop that to 1500 to lose weight. Its calories in vs calories out. your body 
must use more than you intake to lose weight. Another way to trick your body into melting more fat is adjusting macronutrients. the most
commonly used method for weight loss through this approach is carbohydrate manipulation. Carbs are your bodies energy source, when you eat them excess
and your body doesnt need them, they can be stored as fat.To prevent this and even force your body into burning fat, carb cycling is an option.
Consume little to no carbs on one day then day by day increase your carbs to normal levels and repeat.

<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;"><strong style="font-size:50px;">Try a New Routine</strong><br><br>Another common problem is using the same routine.
when you start out, a certain routine may work very well for you, giving you increases in strength and loss of fat. However over 
time your body begins to get used to doing the same motions with similar weights.Shock your body and force it to keep improving by switching it up. try 
Increasing weight and Dropping the number of reps, performing your routine in a different order, or even changing to a new regimine altogether.
